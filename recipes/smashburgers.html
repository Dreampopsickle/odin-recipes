                        <p id="what-is-this">A simple yet delicious cheeseburger recipe. Pretty much the same idea as a slider.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li id="ingrediants">4 hamburger buns</li>
                            <li id="ingrediants">2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
                            <li id="ingrediants">1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
                            <li id="ingrediants">4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
                            <li id="ingrediants">salt to taste</li>
                            <li id="ingrediants">4 slices American cheese</li>
                            <li id="ingrediants">burger toppings of choice</li>
                        </ul>
                         <h3>Steps</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li id="steps">Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. 
                    Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto 
                    the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
                                        <br>
                                 <li id="steps">Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. 
                    Set aside.</li>
                                        <br>
                                <li id="steps">Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. 
                    You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
                                        <br>
                                <li id="steps">Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, 
                    flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. 
                    Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
